**My Documents about Mircoelectronics**

Here’s my part of PDF notes based on what I studied about electronics and analysis. 
There mainly consists of 3 important parts (Diode, BJT, and MOSFET), but I did not conclude the Amplifiers and PN junctions yet. 
<br><br>
Part1: A diode is the simplest semiconductor device, consisting of a p–n junction that allows current to flow in one direction more easily than the other. When forward‐biased (positive voltage on the p‐side relative to the n‐side), current flows readily. When reverse‐biased, current flow is heavily restricted. 
<br><br>
part2: A bipolar junction transistor is formed by two adjoining p–n junctions, giving either an npn or pnp structure. It has three terminals called the base, emitter, and collector. The term “bipolar” reflects that both electrons and holes participate in current flow. By applying a small current into the base terminal, one can control a much larger current from collector to emitter, enabling amplification or switching.
<br><br>
part3: A MOSFET is a field‐effect transistor that uses an electric field to control current flow in a channel between the source and drain terminals, with the gate terminal acting as the control input. The gate is separated from the channel by a thin oxide layer. Because it operates primarily by moving majority carriers (electrons in n‐channel MOSFETs, holes in p‐channel MOSFETs), it consumes very little power to switch states, making it ideal for large‐scale digital integrated circuits.
