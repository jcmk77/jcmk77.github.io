**My Documents about Semiconductor Physics**

Hereâ€™s my PDF document based on what I studied about Semiconductor Physics
There mainly consists of 3 parts. 
<br>
Part1: The microscopic composition of semiconductors, which contains theories such as quantum mechanics
<br>
part2: The use of n-type and p-type semiconductors, such as pn junctions and related applications
<br>
part3: The principles and analysis of BJT and MOSFET include the working principles and applications of each semiconductor device
